There are two files for 2 different hardware

For GTX 10 series, we can use the file named trash_gtx

For RTX 30 series, we can use the file named trash_rtx

There are some files needed to be installed from Google Drive from here:

In the Google Drive, we have yolov4-obj_last.weights. This need to be stored in 'model' folder.

Depends on what file you use, we need to replace the missing files from Google Drive either Trash GTX or Trash RTX into trash_rtx or trash_gtx.

For example, from trash_gtx folder in google drive, download the files and locate in the trash_gtx folder as the same as main.py. The same goes to trash_rtx

yolov3 is for detecting trash only meanwhile yolov4 is for detectin recyclable and non recyclable trash
